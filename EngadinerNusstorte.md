For the dough:
* 175g soft butter
* 25g sugar
* 1 pinch of salt
* Peel of one lemon
* 275g all purpose flour

Knead all ingredients quickly into well blended dough. Let it rest in the fridge for at least 12h

For the filling:
* 150g sugar
* 200ml cream (32% grease)
* 1 table spoon of honey
* 150g coarsely chopped walnuts

Heat the sugar in a pot with a thick bottom until it turns into a golden brown caramel. You decide how brave you are and how dark you like the taste. Reduce the heat and pour in the cream carefully. Stir until the caramel has fully dissolved itself in the cream. Let it boil shortly. 

Remove from the heat and stir in the honey as well. Add the walnuts and let it all cool down to room temperature.

For the cake:
* It's like a classical pie setup...
* Use about half of the dough to fill a 24cm diameter cake pan, about 4mm thick. Use anti-stick paper and butter the walls of the cake pan. 
* Use some more dough to create a "wall" of about 2cm height
* Spread the caramel-nut-mix evenly on the dough
* Rollout the rest of the dough and place it on top of the filling. You might use some egg to glue the dough together.
* Let it bake for 50-60 minutes at 180Â°C.

For the taste:
It gets better if you let it rest for a day or two.
